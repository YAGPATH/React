**Function Components**

- here in our main react app we craeted functional components.
- names are 1. Header, 2. Content, 3. Footer.

- We created them in seprately in src folder, and then imported all those component in App.js.

- imported in App.js because that is the main js which is having our entire website in it andsending it to index.js.

- to make the component template used ctrl+alt+r and then typed "rafce" and our template will be created on its own.

- then write the required data insid ethet component.

- imported it to app.js

**importing statemtnt is**

- import Header from './header';
- import Content from './content';
- import Footer from './footer';

  **then added it to main body**

- <div className="App">
- <Header />
- <Content />
- <Footer />
- </div>
